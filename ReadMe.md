# SimRaNN_Test
This program evaluates a ride (previously adapted using AdaptRide (https://github.com/albertsanchezf/AdaptRide)) stored in adaptedRidePath. It uses the trained Neural Network stored in trainedModelPath.

To run the program variables adaptedRidePath, trainedModelPath, filter and maxIncidents must be correctly set.

The detected incidents are stored in variable positives that contain the window number where the incident is located.
